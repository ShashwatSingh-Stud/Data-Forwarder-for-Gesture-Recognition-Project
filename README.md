# Data-Forwarder-for-Gesture-Recognition-Project
This repository contains the Data Forwarder module designed to support a real-time Gesture Recognition system. It acts as a robust middleware layer that efficiently captures, processes, and transmits gesture data from input devices (e.g., cameras or sensors) to downstream recognition models or visualization interfaces.
